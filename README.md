# Global Climate Changes to Temperature, Disasters, & CO2 Emissions Over Time

## Overview
### Purpose
I wanted to explore how climate change has impacted temperature change and the number of disasters (outputs) over time. I also wanted to explore the relationship of how factors that influence climate change (inputs), such as CO2 emissions, affect temperature change and disasters. Finally, I analyzed countries’ inputs and outputs by region and income level to see how they contribute to and are affected by climate change.

### Data Tools Used
I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to clean, transform, and analyze the data. I then exported csv files from Jupyter Notebook into Tableau, where I visualized the data. The Python code is in Github, and the Tableau dashboard link is [here]([url](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ross.urbina/viz/GlobalClimateVisualizationProject/Dashboard1))


## Insights & Observations
### Main Conclusion
The average temperature change and disasters per country in each income bracket is generally the same and the trends are similar. However, the CO2 emissions produced varies dramatically based on the country’s wealth. This shows that while the high income countries are the main ones responsible for CO2 emissions, all countries face same or similar effects on temperature change and disaster.
