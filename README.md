# Global Climate Changes to Temperature, Disasters, & CO2 Emissions Over Time

## Overview
### Purpose
I wanted to explore how climate change has impacted temperature change and the number of disasters (outputs) over time. I also wanted to explore the relationship of how factors that influence climate change (inputs), such as CO2 emissions, affect temperature change and disasters. Finally, I analyzed countriesâ€™ inputs and outputs by region and income level to see how they contribute to and are affected by climate change.

### Data Tools Used
I used Python in Jupyter Notebook to clean, transform, and analyze the data. I then exported csv files from Jupyter Notebook into Tableau, where I visualized the data. The Python code is in Github, and the Tableau dashboard link is [here]([url](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ross.urbina/viz/GlobalClimateVisualizationProject/Dashboard1))
